## 1. Installation 🛠

This section will tell the user how to install the project locally.

Execute `yarn install` to install all necessary dependencies. Get the latest version of Yarn here: [yarnpkg.com](https://yarnpkg.com/).

For working mock up data copy `api/prismic/config/configuration-dummy.ts`, rename it to `api/prismic/config/configuration.js` and edit the variables.

## 2. Usage 💻

The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after they’ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

### 2.1 Development

Execute `yarn dev` to start the development server. `**/**/test` folders contain snapshots and unit tests.

### 2.2 Testing

Execute `yarn test:all` to run all test scripts. Note that there is a pre-push hook that runs `yarn test:all`.

### 2.3 Build

To run the build version of the project, execute `yarn build`.

### 2.4 Prismic

This setup requires the following custom types:

- homepage
- page
- global_config

Add new slices (prismic modules) inside `api/prismic/slices/map.ts`.

To render slices according to `api/prismic/slices/map.ts.`, use `src/templates/partials/ComponentsRenderer.tsx` like so:

```javascript
<ComponentsRenderer slices={get(data, 'data.body', [])} />
```

Modify `api/prismic/helper/richtextHtmlSerializer.ts` to impact editors richtext input, wich is handled by the Prismic rich text resolver.

It is recommended to use `src/helpers/preventScriptInjection.ts` if the editor has a possibility to insert script inside the Prismic rich text editor.

### 2.5 Languages

Edit languages inside `server/server.ts`.

## 3. Cheat Sheet 🙇‍♂️

Handling prismic rich texts:

```javascript
import { RichText } from 'prismic-reactjs';

const richtText = RichText.render(
  prismic.richtext.object,
  linkResolver,
  htmlSerializer
);
```

Get current breakpoint:

```javascript
const breakpoint = useContext(BreakpointContext);
```

Access theme (variables):

```javascript
const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
```

Access data from prismic's global_conf:

```javascript
const globalData = useContext(GlobalConfigContext);
```

Use `src/components/atoms/NextLink/NextLink.tsx` for internal and external link handling. Links inside a richt text are handled the similar way.
